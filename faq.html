                <p>Having a good number of likes is as important as having a good follower's count. Believe it or not, but this number represents the quality of your image. It is like a review in a sense. Your pictures are great, but in such a big social network as Instagram, your viewers will most likely skip your content without even properly looking at it if you don't have the likes to back it up.</p>

                <p>People by nature are social creatures. This phenomenon is particularly evident in our use of social media. With over 300 million monthly users on Instagram, social media is more active today than ever before. That means that your page's presence is extremely important. If your video only has a few views, people aren't likely to see it as worth watching. But if you buy Instagram views and your video looks popular, more and more people will want to check it out!
